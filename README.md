# Plumo-2D Feather/FeatherWing compatible Development Board for the Afero Platform

## INTRODUCTION

Plumo-2D is a development board for the Afero ASR-2D Secure WiFi/BLE radio architecture based on the ESP32 WiFi/BLE chipset.  Plumo-2D is compatible with Adafruit Feather/FeatherWing form factor boards.

This reference design is meant for customers to use for product prototyping and as a starting point for their own designs.  The Plumo-2D uses the Espressif ESP32-WROOM-32D module + the Afero Hardware Security Module.  Use of the pre-certified Espressif ESP32-WROOM-32D module gives the board FCC/IC, TELEC, and other certifications.

## Design Information
The Plumo-2D design was built using Altium.  The entire Altium project, including scripts that generate the output files, is included.

## Manifest (abridged)
 * **Plumo-2D.PrjPcb** is the toplevel Altium project file.
 * **Plumo-2D.SchDoc** is the Altium schematic file.
 * **Plumo-2D.PcbDoc** is the Altium layout file.
 * **Plumo-2D.IntLib** is an integrated Altium part library for the design.
 * **AssyDrawing.PCBDwf** and **FabDrawing.PCBDwf** are drawing templates for the Assembly and Fabrication drawings.
 * **documentation.OutJob** and **gerbers.OutJob** are the "scripts" for Altium that you can use to generate all of the needed output files (pdf files, gerbers, pick and place info, et cetera).
 * **Plumo-2D.pdf** pdf of the schematics, isometric view of the board, fab and assembly drawings; autogenerated.
 * **gerbers** is the directory where the Gerber output files and ODB++ files are located.  These are the files that one would use when you release the board to fab and assembly; autogenerated.
 * **gerbers/Bill of Materials-Plumo-2D.csv** is the Bill of Materials for the debug version of the board; autogenerated.
 * **LICENSE.txt** Apache 2.0 license governing the use of this design.
